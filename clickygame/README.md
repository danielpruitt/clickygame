#React Click Game

Deployed site: https://legendaryclicky.herokuapp.com/

This site is a Front-end app that is build with React. 
The game is to be played as a memory game so that each card should be clicked once. The user's score is increased with each successful click. If a card is clicked for a second time in the same round the the game is reset.

The state of the score and the top score changes in each round as well as a message describing if the click is correct or incorrect.
